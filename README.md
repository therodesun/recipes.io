# recipes.io
CSC307 Project

reci.p is an app designed to store recipes that users have created. On the app users can add their own recipes to a database, and then search through the database to find recipes. Users can view all recipes in a table page, where an image, name, and the time to make the recipe are displayed. By clicking on these recipes, users are taken to recipe pages, where they can view the ingredients and instructions to create the dish. Users can also click on a button to add all the ingredients to a shopping cart, where they can view what they need to buy
